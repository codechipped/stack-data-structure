## About <a name = "about"></a>

A simple template for a custom (LILO) stack data structure in C++

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
You only need the stack.h file, but I included a demonstration of it working.
```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

After including stack.h in your project you can intialize the custom stack as any other class.

- push() adds an item to the stack
- pop() removes the last item added to the stack
- size() returns the amout of items in the stack
- empty() returns a boolean of true if the stack is empty
